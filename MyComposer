Iteration 2:
- 
please generate a mood based recipe recommendation app. 
I want the user to select their mood and then get a recipe based on that mood shown to them. 

They should be able to request a new recipe if they don't like that one.  
I want to make this as simple as possible. 
Please use express for the backend, 
sqlite for storing the recipes and javascript, html and css for the front end

-----
1. Once the code download is complete, please run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm init -y
npm install express sqlite3 cors

2. Create the project structure:
- public
-- index.html
-- style.css
-- script.js
- server.js
- database.js

3. Start the server by running the following command:
node server.js

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

Note: We've replaced Tailwind CSS with a custom style.css file for better control over the styles.
