Iteration 1:
- 

please generate a mood based receipe reccommendation app. 
I want the user to select their mood and then get a recipe based on that mood shown to them. 

They should be able to request a new recipe if they dont like that one.  
I want to make this as simple as possible. 
Please use express for the backend, 
sqlite for for storing the recipes and javascript,html and css with tailwind for the front end
